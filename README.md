# Voice To Text
This is a very simple project I built during my first week at 46elks. It is far from perfect, but it does work. (English only)

## Get started

### Prerequisites
- Python installed. (>= v2.7)
- The following packages installed:
  - [bottle](http://docs.python-requests.org/)
  - [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
  - [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
  - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- A [46elks](https://46elks.com) account with a number that supports both calls and MMS.

### Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Copy the `.env-example` into a new file called `.env` in the root directory.
3. Update the `.env` configuration file to contain the correct values.
4. Run the `src/app.py` and you're good to go!
